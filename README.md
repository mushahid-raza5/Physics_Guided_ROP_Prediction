# Physics-Guided ROP Prediction

**Combining classical drilling physics with statistical modeling to predict Rate of Penetration (ROP) from ~53,000 real-time well observations.**

---

## Overview

This project applies a **physics-guided machine learning** approach to predict drilling Rate of Penetration (ROP) the speed at which the drill bit penetrates rock. Instead of relying solely on statistical regression, we integrate the **Bingham ROP equation**, a well-established petroleum engineering model, and compare it against a log-transformed linear baseline.

The key insight: by using **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** analysis to systematically remove collinear variables (SPPA, TFLO, Torque, HKLD, MD), we reduce 7 candidate features down to just 2 **Weight on Bit (WOB)** and **RPM**, which are the exact inputs to the classical Bingham model. Statistics and domain physics converge.

## Results

| Model | Type | RMSE (m/h) |
|-------|------|------------|
| Log-MLR | Statistical Baseline | 7.8946 |
| **Bingham** | **Physics-Guided (MLE)** | **7.8215** |

The physics-guided Bingham model achieves a **lower RMSE** while using a physically interpretable functional form:

$$\text{ROP} = K \cdot \left(\frac{\text{WOB}}{D_b}\right)^a \cdot \text{RPM}$$

where `K = 0.4287` (drillability constant) and `a = 0.2127` (WOB exponent) are estimated via nonlinear least-squares.

## Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: scatter plots, histograms, correlation heatmaps
2. **VIF-Based Variable Selection**: iteratively removing features with VIF > 5 to eliminate multicollinearity
3. **Log-MLR Baseline**: `log(ROP) ~ WOB + RPM` via OLS (R² = 0.384)
4. **Bingham Physics Model**: nonlinear curve fitting via `scipy.optimize.curve_fit`
5. **Residual Diagnostics**: Q-Q plots, Breusch–Pagan heteroscedasticity test
